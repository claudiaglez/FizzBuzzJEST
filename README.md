## :page_with_curl: Description

The main objective of this project is to implement a program that prints numbers from 1 to 100 following certain special conditions.

* The program must print ‘Fizz’ instead of numbers divisible by 3.
* ‘Buzz’ instead of numbers divisible by 5.
* ‘FizzBuzz’ instead of numbers divisible by both 3 and 5.
* In all other cases, it should print the number itself.
